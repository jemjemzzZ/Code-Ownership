c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c,CWE-131,CVE-2022-41887,,,,,,,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH,7.5,HIGH,"TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. `tf.keras.losses.poisson` receives a `y_pred` and `y_true` that are passed through `functor::mul` in `BinaryOp`. If the resulting dimensions overflow an `int32`, TensorFlow will crash due to a size mismatch during broadcast assignment. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit c5b30379ba87cbe774b08ac50c1f6d36df4ebb7c. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1 and 2.9.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range. However, we will not cherrypick this commit into TensorFlow 2.8.x, as it depends on Eigen behavior that changed between 2.8 and 2.9."
,CWE-22,CVE-2021-35958,LOW,NONE,PARTIAL,NONE,6.4,PARTIAL,NETWORK,LOW,NONE,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,HIGH,HIGH,9.1,CRITICAL,** DISPUTED ** TensorFlow through 2.5.0 allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a crafted archive when tf.keras.utils.get_file is used with extract=True. NOTE: the vendor's position is that tf.keras.utils.get_file is not intended for untrusted archives.
12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b,CWE-191,CVE-2021-41196,LOW,NONE,PARTIAL,NONE,2.1,NONE,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,UNCHANGED,NONE,NONE,HIGH,5.5,MEDIUM,"TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions the Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or if a dimension is negative. This is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where the values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012,CWE-502,CVE-2021-37678,LOW,NONE,PARTIAL,PARTIAL,4.6,PARTIAL,LOCAL,LOW,LOW,NONE,CHANGED,HIGH,HIGH,HIGH,8.8,HIGH,"TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. In affected versions TensorFlow and Keras can be tricked to perform arbitrary code execution when deserializing a Keras model from YAML format. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/460e000de3a83278fb00b61a16d161b1964f15f4/tensorflow/python/keras/saving/model_config.py#L66-L104) uses `yaml.unsafe_load` which can perform arbitrary code execution on the input. Given that YAML format support requires a significant amount of work, we have removed it for now. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit 23d6383eb6c14084a8fc3bdf164043b974818012. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range."
